# martrioska

The martrioska project has been carried out for the exam of Electronic Publishing and Digital Storytelling held by Professor Marilena Daquino, within the Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge course at the University of Bologna.

Check the [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/martrioska/martrioska.github.io) of the project.

## Goal
The general objective of the project is meant to question topics related to the field of art history, exploiting linked open data as much as possible and taking advantage of the information available on the ARTchives project and other data-driven realities such as Wikidata.

## Research question
Our study focuses on the issue of gender inequality, observing the distribution of the male and female component in the history of art, reflecting and analysing the limited visibility of the latter.
